         (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to structure content on the web.

          links using tags, forming the basic skeleton of a webpage.

       <h2>Git and GitHub</h2>
       <h3>Git</h3>
      <p> This is a version control system that helps developers 
        track changes in their code over time. It allows you 
        to save different versions (called commits) of your
      project, go back to previous versions if needed, and work on 
      different features This makes it especially helpful for managing code in 
      both individual and team projects.
    </p>
    <h3>GitHub</h3>  
    <p>This a cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories online. 
      It enhances Git by providing tools for collaboration, such as pull requests,
       code reviews, and issue tracking. Git and GitHub work together by allowing you 
       to write and commit code on your local machine using Git, and then push it to 
       GitHub to store it online or share it with others. This setup is essential for modern software 
       development because it enables teamwork, protects against data loss, and makes code easy to manage and review. 
       GitHub also doubles as a professional portfolio where developers can showcase their projects and 
       contributions to the tech community.
