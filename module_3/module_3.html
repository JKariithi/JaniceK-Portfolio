      <h2>Electronic Circuits and Components</h2>
      <p>An electronic circuit is a structure that directs and controls
        electric current to perform various functions.
      </p>
      <p>The simplest circuit has these three key components 
        <ul>
          <li><b>Conducting path</b>: Where the current flows. Copper wires are used
          for this but they are being replaced by conductive traces.
        </li>
        <li><b>Voltage Source</b>:Provides a potential differences between two points in
        the circuit. It is a two terminal device such as batteries, genetators or power
        systems
        </li>
        <li><b>Load</b>: Consumes power to perform a particular function. Light bulb is the simplest example. </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h3> Types of Electronic Circuits</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><u>Open Circuit</u></li>
        <p>Where the current can't flow as one or two components are 
          disconnected intentionally using a switch or accidentally. 
        </p>
        <li><u>Closed Circuit</u></li>
        <p>Where the circuit forms a complete loop with no interruptions. This is regardless 
          if it performs or doesn't perform a circuit.

        </p>
        <li><u>Short Circuit</u></li>
        <p>This is  low resistance connection forms between two points in an electronic circuit.
          As a result the current tends to flow through this newly formed connection 
          rather than along the intended path.
          They are however dangerous and lead to serious accidents.

        <li><u>Printed Circuit Boards(PCBs)</u></li>
        <p>A layout of a cicuit printed chemically onto a plastic board. Mostly used in
           complex electronic circuits are required.</p>

        <li><u>Intergrated Circuits</u></li>
        <p>Tiny electronic circuits that can fit inside a small chip. Main purpose is to increase effeciency 
          of the electronic devices while reducing manufacturing cost.

      <h2>Electronic Components</h2>
      <h3>Capacitor</h3>
      <p>A passive two-terminal electrical component that works as a small rechargeable battery that stores electricity.
        However unlike a battery can charge and discharge within a split second.
