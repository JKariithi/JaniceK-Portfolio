      <h3>Embedded Systems</h3>
      <p>Embedded systems is a combination of 
        hardware and software designed for a specific function.
        Basic hardware in embedded systems consists of:
        Sensors, Analog-to-digital converters, Processors, Digital-to-analog converters and acutuators.
        Types of embedded systems in terms of functional requuirements: 
        Mobile, Networked, Standalone and Real-time embedded systems.
        Commmon software architechture in embedded systems: 
        Simple, Interrupt, Cooporative multitasking and Preemptive multitasking/ multithreading controlled loops.
        Embedded systems trends:
        AI and ML, Edge computing, Security, Increases connectivity and Quantum Computing. 
      </p>
      <h3>IDEs</h3>
      <p>An IDE for embedded systems combines various tools needed for 
        software development into one application, simplifying the process.
     </p>
     <p>Key components:
      <ul>
        <li> <b>Code Editor</b>: 
          Provides a platform for writing and editing source code.</li>
        <li> <b>Compiler</b>:
          Translates human-readable code 
          into machine code that the embedded system can understand.
        </li>
        <li> <b>Debugger</b>:
          Helps identify and fix errors in the code by allowing 
          developers to step through the code, inspect variables, and set breakpoints.
        </li>
      </ul>
     </p>
     <p> In this section we looked at Arduino and Thonny IDEs. </p>
