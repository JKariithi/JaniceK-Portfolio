      <h2>Embedded Systems</h2>
      <p>Embedded systems is a combination of 
        hardware and software designed for a specific function.
        Basic hardware in embedded systems consists of:
        Sensors, Analog-to-digital converters, Processors, Digital-to-analog converters and acutuators.
        Types of embedded systems in terms of functional requuirements: 
        Mobile, Networked, Standalone and Real-time embedded systems.
        Commmon software architechture in embedded systems: 
        Simple, Interrupt, Cooporative multitasking and Preemptive multitasking/ multithreading controlled loops.
        Embedded systems trends:
        AI and ML, Edge computing, Security, Increases connectivity and Quantum Computing. 
      </p>    
      <h2>IDEs</h2>
      <p>An IDE for embedded systems combines various tools needed for 
        software development into one application, simplifying the process.
     </p>
     <p>Key components:
      <ul>
        <li> <b>Code Editor</b>: 
          Provides a platform for writing and editing source code.</li>
        <li> <b>Compiler</b>:
          Translates human-readable code 
          into machine code that the embedded system can understand.
        </li>
        <li> <b>Debugger</b>:
          Helps identify and fix errors in the code by allowing 
          developers to step through the code, inspect variables, and set breakpoints.
        </li>
      </ul>
     </p>
     <p> In this section we looked at Arduino and Thonny IDEs. </p>

      <h2>C programming language</h2>
      <div class="media-placeholder">

      <p>C is a powerful, low-level language that gives developers fine-grained control
         over system resources. It is most commonly used in operating systems, embedded systems,
         and performance-critical applications because of its speed and efficiency.</p>
     <p>
  I learnt to code in C using this 
  <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjavYOFoJJ0&list=PLdo5W4Nhv31a8UcMN9-35ghv8qyFWD9_S" >YouTube Playlist</a></em>
  and 
  <em><a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-087-practical-programming-in-c-january-iap-2010/" target="_blank">course</a></em>, and I documented most of the process in the 
  git repository below.
  I highly recommend them to anyone starting out with C programming.

      <h2>My Takeaways</h2>
      <ul>
  <li>Different types of embedded systems exist, each suited for specific applicationsâ€”it's important to understand their use cases.</li>
  <li>C is a compiled language, meaning the code must be compiled before it can be executed.</li>
  <li>The Arduino IDE is well-suited for developing and uploading code to embedded hardware devices.</li>
